# SSL and HTTPS

Ackee runs a simple server that doesn't support TSL/SSL. This means it's not possible to directly connect via HTTPS. It's recommended to use a reverse proxy instead. This document explains how.

## What is a reverse proxy?

> A reverse proxy is a type of proxy server that retrieves resources on behalf of a client from one or more servers. These resources are then returned to the client, appearing as if they originated from the proxy server itself.

A reverse proxy makes it easy for you to run Ackee on your server along with other services. It also allows you to secure connections using TLS/SSL.

I highly recommend [this article](https://medium.com/intrinsic/why-should-i-use-a-reverse-proxy-if-node-js-is-production-ready-5a079408b2ca) if you want to lean more about reverse proxies.

## Example configurations

- [Nginx](#nginx)
- [Caddy](#caddy)

### nginx

- [Recommended configuration](#recommended-configuration)
- [Single domain configuration](#single-domain-configuration)
- [Insecure wildcard configuration](#insecure-wildcard-configuration)

#### Recommended configuration

This configuration redirects all requests to the non-www domain `example.com`, secures connections using TSL/SSL and allows CORS requests from a list of known domains.

> 👉 The CORS headers are required so your sites can send data to Ackee, even when their domain is different to the one Ackee uses.

```conf

# Set "$cors_header" to avoid "if" inside location context

#
map $http_origin $cors_header {
    default "";
    ~*^https://([^/]+\.)*(domainone|domaintwo)\.com$ $http_origin;
}

#
# Redirect all www to non-www
#
server {
    listen 80;
    listen 443 ssl;

    server_name www.example.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem;

    return 301 https://example.com$request_uri;
}

#
# Redirect all non-encrypted to encrypted
#
server {
    listen 80;

    server_name example.com;

    return 301 https://example.com$request_uri;
}

#
# There we go
#
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;

    server_name example.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem;

    access_log /var/log/nginx/log/example.com.access.log main;
    error_log  /var/log/nginx/log/example.com.error.log;

    location / {
        add_header          Access-Control-Allow-Origin "$cors_header" always;
        add_header          Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET, POST, PATCH, OPTIONS" always;
        add_header          Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Content-Type, Authorization, Time-Zone" always;
        add_header          Access-Control-Allow-Credentials "true" always;
        add_header          Access-Control-Max-Age "3600" always;
        add_header          Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000" always;
        add_header          X-Frame-Options deny;
        proxy_pass          http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_next_upstream error timeout invalid_header http_500 http_502 http_503 http_504;
        proxy_redirect      off;
        proxy_buffering     off;
        proxy_set_header    Host $host;
        proxy_set_header    X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

#### Single domain configuration

This configuration secures all connections using TSL/SSL and allows `https://example.com` to send data to `https://ackee.example.com`.

> ℹ️ This configuration only allows requests from a single domain. Take a look at our [recommended configuration](#recommended-configuration) if you want to allow requests from multiple domains or use the [insecure wildcard configuration](#insecure-wildcard-configuration).

```conf
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;

    server_name ackee.example.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/ackee.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/ackee.example.com/privkey.pem;

    access_log /var/log/nginx/log/ackee.example.com.access.log main;
    error_log  /var/log/nginx/log/ackee.example.com.error.log;

    location / {
        add_header          Access-Control-Allow-Origin "https://example.com" always;
        add_header          Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET, POST, PATCH, OPTIONS" always;
        add_header          Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Content-Type, Authorization, Time-Zone" always;
        add_header          Access-Control-Allow-Credentials "true" always;
        add_header          Access-Control-Max-Age "3600" always;
        add_header          Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000" always;
        add_header          X-Frame-Options deny;
        proxy_pass          http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_next_upstream error timeout invalid_header http_500 http_502 http_503 http_504;
        proxy_redirect      off;
        proxy_buffering     off;
        proxy_set_header    Host $host;
        proxy_set_header    X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

#### Insecure wildcard configuration

A wildcard (`*`) isn't recommended as it's neither a secure solution nor does it allow Ackee to ignore your own visits. Please disable the `ignoreOwnVisits` option in ackee-tracker if using a wildcard is the only option for you.

```conf
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;

    server_name ackee.example.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/ackee.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/ackee.example.com/privkey.pem;

    access_log /var/log/nginx/log/ackee.example.com.access.log main;
    error_log  /var/log/nginx/log/ackee.example.com.error.log;

    location / {
        add_header          Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*" always;
        add_header          Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET, POST, PATCH, OPTIONS" always;
        add_header          Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Content-Type, Authorization, Time-Zone" always;
        add_header          Access-Control-Max-Age "3600" always;
        add_header          Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000" always;
        add_header          X-Frame-Options deny;
        proxy_pass          http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_next_upstream error timeout invalid_header http_500 http_502 http_503 http_504;
        proxy_redirect      off;
        proxy_buffering     off;
        proxy_set_header    Host $host;
        proxy_set_header    X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

### Caddy
#### Recommended configuration

This configuration redirects all requests to the non-www domain `example.com`, securing connections via Caddy's [Automatic TSL/SSL](https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https). If Ackee is serving over HTTP, modern browsers likely will block `/tracker.js` for mixed content, making HTTPS very valuble. In addition, it enables the correct [CORS headers](https://docs.ackee.electerious.com/#/docs/CORS%20headers). 

> 👉 The CORS headers are required so your sites can send data to Ackee, even when their domain is different to the one Ackee uses.

It also includes an optional directive to only serve the analytics console to designated IP addresses. It does this by limiting non-designated IP's to `/tracker.js` and `/api`, the two pages necessary for analytics collection. This rule provides additional security if required. Uncommented directive to enable. 

Be sure to substitute `example.com` and `example.ip.to.whitelist`, if whitelist is in use. `/tracker.js` must be changed as well if your tracking script has another name, set by the `ACKEE_TRACKER` variable.
```
example.com:443 {
    
    # Change if Ackee is not running on default port
    reverse_proxy :3000

    header {
        Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com
        Access-Control-Allow-Methods: "GET, POST, PATCH, OPTIONS"
        Access-Control-Allow-Headers: "Content-Type, Authorization, Time-Zone"
        Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
        Access-Control-Max-Age: 3600
    }

    # Uncomment out the following to enable whitelisting for the analytics console 
    #@Denied {
    #    not client_ip private_ranges example.ip.to.whitelist
    #    not path /tracker.js /api
    #}
    #abort @Denied

}
```
To whitelist additional IP's, append them after example.ip.to.whitelist.
