# Get started

## Requirements

Ackee dependents on â€¦

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v10.16 or newer)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) (v4.0.6 or newer)

Make sure to install and update all dependencies before you fork and setup Ackee.

## Setup

- [With Docker Compose](#with-docker-compose)
- [With Docker](#with-docker)
- [Without Docker](#without-docker)

### With Docker Compose

#### 1. Create the configuration

Create a [`.env` file](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) in the root of this project to store all environment variables in one file.

```
ACKEE_USERNAME=username
ACKEE_PASSWORD=password
```

The [README](../README.md#Options) contains a detailed explanation of all available options, but only those two are required to run Ackee with the existing `docker-compose.yml`.

#### 2. Run Ackee

Run this command in the root of the project to use the predefined `docker-compose.yml`. It contains everything you need, including MongoDB and Ackee.

```
docker-compose up
```

> ðŸ’¡ Add the `-d` flag to the Docker command to run the services in the background.

#### 3. Open Ackee

Ackee will output the URL it's listening on once the server is running. Visit the URL with your browser and complete the finial steps using the interface.

### With Docker

#### 1. Setup MongoDB

Ackee requires a running MongoDB instance. The easiest way to install MongoDB is by using [Docker](https://www.docker.com). Skip this step if you have MongoDB installed or visit the [website of MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) for alternative setups.

```
docker run -p 27017:27017 --name mongo mongo
```

For persistent storage, mount a host directory to the container directory `/data/db`, which is identified as a potential mount point in the mongo Dockerfile. When starting a new container, Docker will use the volume of the previous container and copy it to the new container, ensuring that no data gets lost.

```
docker run -p 27017:27017 -v /path/to/local/folder:/data/db --name mongo mongo
```

> ðŸ’¡ Add the `-d` flag to the Docker command to run MongoDB in the background.

Explanation:

- `-p` makes port `27017` available at port `27017` on the host
- `-v` mounts `/path/to/local/folder` to `/data/db` of the container
- `--name` sets the container name to `mongo`
- `mongo` is the name of the image

#### 2. Run Ackee

```
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e ACKEE_MONGODB='mongodb://mongo:27017/ackee' -e ACKEE_USERNAME='username' -e ACKEE_PASSWORD='password' --link mongo --name ackee electerious/ackee
```

> ðŸ’¡ Add the `-d` flag to the Docker command to run Ackee in the background.

Explanation:

- `-p` makes port `3000` available at port `3000` on the host
- `-e` sets [environment variables](../README.md#Options) required by Ackee
- `--link` links Ackee with the `mongo` container
- `--name` sets the container name to `ackee`
- `electerious/ackee` is the name of the image

#### 3. Open Ackee

Ackee will output the URL it's listening on once the server is running. Visit the URL with your browser and complete the finial steps using the interface.

### Without Docker

#### 1. Setup MongoDB

Ackee requires a running MongoDB instance. Visit the [website of MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) for installation instructions.

#### 2. Create the configuration

Configure Ackee using environment variables or create a [`.env` file](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) in the root of the project to store all variables in one file.

```
ACKEE_MONGODB=mongodb://localhost:27017/ackee
ACKEE_USERNAME=username
ACKEE_PASSWORD=password
```

The [README](../README.md#Options) contains a detailed explanation of all available options, but only those three are required to run Ackee.

The [MongoDB connection string](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/) is used to connect to your MongoDB. It should also contain the username and password of your MongoDB instance when required.

The username and password variables are used to secure your Ackee interface/API.

#### 3. Install Ackee

Install all required dependencies.

```
yarn
```

#### 4. Run Ackee

Ackee will output the URL it's listening on once the server is running. Visit the URL with your browser and complete the finial steps using the interface.

```
yarn start
```
