# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.0.2] - 2021-01-21

### Fixed

- Temporary workaround for missing browser sizes (#217)

## [3.0.1] - 2021-01-21

### Fixed

- UI showing the wrong version
- Server serving an outdated version of ackee-tracker

## [3.0.0] - 2021-01-21

Events, browser navigation and better referrers 🎉

### Highlights

#### Events

Ackee can now [track events](docs/Events.md) like newsletter subscriptions, buttons clicks, checkout sums and more. It's the most requested feature and I'm happy that it's finally a part of Ackee.

#### Browser navigation

You can now use the back and forward buttons to navigate between pages.

#### Referrers 2.0

You can now [specify a `source` parameter in URLs](docs/Enhancing%20referrers.md) (e.g. `https://example.com?source=Newsletter`). Ackee will use the parameter instead of the referrer when available. This allows you the track links from newsletters and other platforms more precisely.

#### Faster startup, smaller size

Ackee previously had to compile all source files before the server was ready. v3 now ships with all files Ackee needs and only builds those containing environment variables. This means running `yarn start` is way faster and the Docker container even smaller.

Oh, and we also reduced the JS file size of the UI by ~60%.

### Breaking changes

#### New `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header

> This change is relevant for everyone.

Ackee requires [a new `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header](docs/CORS%20headers.md#credentials) which was previously optional. Make sure to add this header in your server or reverse proxy configuration.

#### ackee-tracker with new `.create` and `.record` syntax

> This change is only relevant for you when using ackee-tracker in the [Manually](https://github.com/electerious/ackee-tracker/blob/master/README.md#manually) or [Programmatic](https://github.com/electerious/ackee-tracker/blob/master/README.md#programmatic) way.

The [changelog of ackee-tracker](https://github.com/electerious/ackee-tracker/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) contains everything you need to know when updating to the newest version.

#### Referrers require `ReferrerType` in GraphQL API

> This change is relevant for you when using the GraphQL API.

A new parameter is required when requesting referrers via the GraphQL API. The parameter is called `ReferrerType` and can be `WITH_SOURCE`, `NO_SOURCE` or `ONLY_SOURCE`.

#### Referrers can return non URL ids via GraphQL API

> This change is relevant for you when using the GraphQL API.

The `id` of requested referrers was always a URL, but has been changed to a string. That's because [referrers can now include parameters](docs/Enhancing%20referrers.md) (e.g. `source` when using `ackee-tracker`).

### Added

- Browser navigation. It's now possible to navigate using the back and forward button in the browser.
- "Copied to clipboard" message when clicking on an input or textarea that copies to the clipboard (#166)
- Modals can be closed with the ESC key
- Tests for permanent tokens, events and actions
- `source` field for records to track (thanks @BetaHuhn, #185)
- Referrers will now show the `source` parameter when available (thanks @BetaHuhn, #185)
- Use the `s` key to open the settings and `o` to switch to the overview ([Keyboard shortcuts](docs/Keyboard%20shortcuts.md))
- Explanation why data is missing (#192)

### Changed

- Compiled source files are now part of the repo
- Docker container size has been reduced (again)
- Updated build tools allow us to use ~60% less JS in the UI

### Fixed

- Close, delete and submit in modals could be triggered multiple times

## [2.4.1] - 2020-12-20

### Changed

- Updated Dockerfile reduces the size of the Docker build by ~58% (#195, thanks @omBratteng)

### Fixed

- Errors from permanent tokens not showing up in the UI
- Remove console logs from `apollo-server-plugin-http-headers`
- Log GraphQL error instead of `undefined`

## [2.4.0] - 2020-11-15

Ackee now ignores your own visits once you have logged into the dashboard. Make sure to enable the [`ignoreOwnVisits` option in ackee-tracker](https://github.com/electerious/ackee-tracker#-options) to use this feature. It's currently opt-in, because it requires [a new `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header](docs/CORS%20headers.md#credentials), which wasn't previously required. It will be turned on by default in the next major release of Ackee.

> ℹ️ Some browsers strictly block third-party cookies when Ackee runs on a different domain than the site you're visiting. Therefore, it may happen that your own visits still find their way into your statistics, even when the option `ignoreOwnVisits` is turned on.

### Added

- Ignore own visits (#100, thanks @yehudab)
- Tons of new tests (#171, thanks @yehudab)

## [2.3.0] - 2020-11-04

This release adds [support for Vercel](docs/Get%20started.md) and updates the included `ackee-tracker` which now ignores bots.

### Added

- Support for Vercel (#180, thanks @elliottsj)
- Contributing guide and issue templates (#184, thanks @BetaHuhn)

### Changed

- ackee-tracker updated to version 4.1.0

## [2.2.0] - 2020-11-01

New tools like [ackee-report](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/ackee-report), [ackee-bitbar](https://github.com/electerious/ackee-bitbar) and the [Ackee iOS widget](https://twitter.com/getackee/status/1320996848623099909) are build upon the powerful API of Ackee. This release makes it even easier to them by introducing permanent tokens. Permanent tokens never expire and are perfect for tools that run in the background. You can create them in the settings of Ackee and use them for authentication in Ackee-powered apps.

### Added

- Permanent tokens (#176, thanks @BetaHuhn)

### Fixed

- Serverless function CORS headers (#175)

## [2.1.1] - 2020-10-28

### Fixed

- Error while deploying to Netlify (#175)

## [2.1.0] - 2020-10-24

This release introduces support for serverless functions. You can now deploy Ackee to Netlify 🚀 It also reduces the memory usage and allows you to build all static files into `/dist` by running `yarn build`. Run `yarn server` to start the server without building those files, again. This reduces the initial startup time. `yarn start` combines both commands for convenience and is still the recommended way to run Ackee.

### Added

- Support for serverless functions and Netlify (#155)
- Added "Deploy to Netlify" to the [Get Started](docs/Get%20started.md) guide
- Build all static files into `/dist` by running `yarn build`
- Start the server without rebuilding static files using `yarn server`

### Changed

- Improved scrollbars on Windows (#153, thanks @Go-Merk)

### Fixed
