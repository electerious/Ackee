## Introduction

### What is Ackee?

Ackee is a web app you install on your server to analyse the traffic of your sites.

### Why Ackee?

Ackee is lightweight, easy to install and has a good balance between analytics and privacy. It features an API and web interface and tracks only what's necessary.

It's is the right tool for you if you care about privacy and don't need a full-features marketing analytics platform like Google Analytics or Matomo.

### Benefits of Ackee?

- Self-hosted
- Lightweight and easy to install
- Modern and fast architecture
- Beautiful and focused interface
- No unique user tracking and no cookies
- Fully documented API

### How does it work?

You run the Ackee server which then waits for requests through its API.

The API of Ackee accepts information about your visitors sent to it using [ackee-tracker](https://github.com/electerious/ackee-tracker). It's a small script you add to your sites, similar to the JavaScript tracking snippet provided by Google Analytics.

The interface of Ackee lets you view and analyse your tracked information.
